# Next.js 15 App Router: Unexpected Redirect Behavior with getServerSideProps

This repository demonstrates an unexpected issue encountered when using `getServerSideProps` within the Next.js 15 App Router.  The `getServerSideProps` function, designed to redirect based on certain conditions, exhibits unusual behavior that differs from the expected functionality.

## Problem

The `getServerSideProps` function in the provided example is intended to redirect the user to a different page based on some condition. However, under certain conditions (e.g., specific client requests), the redirect does not work as intended, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Observe the behavior under different conditions to replicate the unpredictable redirect.

## Expected Behavior

The `getServerSideProps` function should consistently redirect the user to the specified URL when the specified condition is met.

## Actual Behavior

The redirect doesn't work reliably, sometimes loading the default page instead of the intended redirect page. This is inconsistent and breaks the expected behavior of a redirect within the `getServerSideProps` function.

## Solution

See the `bugSolution.js` file for a potential solution.
